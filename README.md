# Data-Analysis
Welcome to my data-engineering repository! This collection contains a variety of Python projects focused on data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and machine learning model development.
Here you'll find practical implementations using industry-standard libraries such as:

* Data Manipulation & Analysis:
NumPy, Pandas for efficient numerical computations and data handling.

* Data Visualization:
Seaborn, Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations.

* Machine Learning Pipelines:
Scikit-learn for building robust pipelines that include data preprocessing (e.g., imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding), model training, and evaluation with algorithms like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors.

* Model Persistence:
Joblib for saving and loading models to streamline experimentation and deployment.

This repository is designed to showcase best practices in data engineering and machine learning, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation using metrics like confusion matrices and accuracy scores. Whether you're exploring data science fundamentals or advanced pipeline construction, you'll find modular, well-documented projects here that are ready for collaboration and further development.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute!
