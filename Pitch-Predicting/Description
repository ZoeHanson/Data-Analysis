The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the type of pitch thrown by Shohei Ohtani based on various pitch characteristics. 
The model will assist Major League Baseball (MLB) in automatically displaying the pitch type in real-time during broadcasts and in-stadium displays.
