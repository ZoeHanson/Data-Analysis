The primary research goal is for the chosen model to yield reliable interpretive insights about the nature of the relationships between the variables in the dataset and to predict whether a billionaire is self-made as correctly as possible.

The secondary research goal is to build a predictive model that will effectively determine whether a billionaire is self-made or born into their wealth for new datasets. The explanatory variables considered from this dataset are finalWorth, industries, gender, age, and country.

Someone who may be interested in the final model could be someone looking to reach out specifically to a self-made billionaire for sponsorship or advertisement opportunities.
